    Output: daily time series of Tmin, Tmax, Prec (csv files)
    Modality: CLIMATE or SEASONAL_FORECAST

    CLIMATE test: uncomment #define TEST_WG_CLIMATE
    It generates one year of synthetic data for two points
    -   climate data in data/input/climate
    -   wg settings in data/testWG_climate.ini

    SEASONAL_FORECAST test: uncomment #define TEST_WG_SEASONAL
    It generates seasonal forecast (JJA 2016) for two points
    Output is a time series of synthetic data for the JJA season
    and observed data of the previous 9 months
    Synthetic data are computed by wg climate + forecast anomalies
    Nr. of output data years depending on nr. of model members in xml files
    -   climate data in data/input/climate
    -   observed data in data/input/observed
    -   seasonal forecast (xml files) in data/input/seasonalForecast_2016_JJA
    -   wg settings in data/testWG_seasonal.ini
